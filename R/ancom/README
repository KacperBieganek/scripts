Around 10.3.2017

Received ANCOM from the original authors and did some modifications to
test with example data:
main.R

In addition, there is the second implementation from the
Weiss review paper (code received from those authors) and
my own comparisons:
ancom_anotherimplementation.R
ANCOM.Rmd

The two implementations give somewhat different results. The version
used in main.R is more similar to ANOVA and DESeq2.
